Comparator and Comparable are two java interface used to used to sort objects based on values of data members.


Comparable interface compare object with itself and Class must implement this interface by itself to be compared.
Comparable interface uses compareTo method to compare objects, as there is single implementation on "single sorting sequence" is provided by comparator.



Comparator is a external element which is used to compare two objects.
We can write multiple classes to implement Comparator using different data memebers hence multiple sorting sequence can be provided.
Comparator uses compare method to sort objects.
