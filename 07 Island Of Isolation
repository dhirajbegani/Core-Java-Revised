Island Of Isolation:

In Java inaccessible objects are freed from memory by Garbage Collector.
State where Objects are still referenced by other objects but they are still eligible for garbage collection is Island of Isolation.

Class Test{
Test obj;
}


Test t1 = new Test();
Test t2 = new Test();

t1.obj = t2;

t2.obj = t1;

// as of now no objects are eligible for garbage collection as t2 is referring them.
t1= null;

t2=null;
// Now object t1 and t2 are in island of Isolation.
//There is no way for external program to access them and the're still referring each other.
