Stack Memory:
  The stack grows and shrinks as functions push and pop local variables
  There is no need to manage the memory yourself, variables are allocated and freed automatically
  Stack memory has size limits
  Stack variables only exist while the function that created them, is running.
  
 Heap Memory:
  Variables can be accessed globally
  No limit on memory size
  Relatively slower access
  No guaranteed efficient use of space, memory may become fragmented over time as blocks of memory are allocated, then freed.
  Garbage Collector is an automatic memory management system that reclaims heap memory for objects.
